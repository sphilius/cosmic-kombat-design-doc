# Training Mode Design

## Core Philosophy

The training mode in Cosmic Kombat serves as both an educational tool and a laboratory for players of all skill levels. It follows three core principles:

1. **Accessibility**: New players should understand core mechanics quickly
2. **Depth**: Advanced players should have tools for precise practice
3. **Analysis**: Data-driven feedback to measure improvement
