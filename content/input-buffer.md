# Input Buffer Simulation

The Input Buffer System in Cosmic Kombat allows players to master frame-perfect execution.

## Key Features

- **Visual Buffer Display**: See exactly when inputs are registered
- **Leniency Adjustment**: Configure from 1F (tournament) to 5F (casual)
- **Just Frame Training**: Practice perfect timing with audio/visual feedback
- **Input Cleanup**: Identify and eliminate extraneous inputs

## Advanced Options

- **Custom Buffer Windows**: Adjust timing for specific moves
- **Negative Edge Training**: Practice release-based inputs
- **Input Pattern Analysis**: Get statistical feedback on input accuracy

## Tier-Specific Considerations

Higher-tier characters require more precise inputs:

- More complex motion inputs
- Tighter timing windows
- More cancel options
- Advanced chaining requirements

The system provides tier-specific training scenarios to accommodate this increased complexity.
