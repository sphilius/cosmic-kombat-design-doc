### Domain 3: Content Systems To-Do List

---

#### 1. Create Comprehensive Art Style Guide

**Overall Goal:** Define the complete visual identity of the game to ensure a consistent and high-quality look and feel across all assets.

*   **1.1: Create Mood Board and Visual References**
    *   **Information Needed:** A collection of 20+ images, screenshots, and concept art from other games, films, and media that establish the target mood, color palette, and aesthetic.
    *   **Definition of Done:** A digital mood board (e.g., on Miro, Figma, or a shared folder) is created, reviewed, and approved by the project leads.

*   **1.2: Define Character Design Principles**
    *   **Information Needed:** A document outlining the core principles of character design, including silhouette guidelines, proportion rules, level of detail, and style (e.g., "stylized realism").
    *   **Definition of Done:** A "Character Design" section is written and added to the Art Style Guide with clear written principles and visual examples.

*   **1.3: Define Environment Art Direction**
    *   **Information Needed:** A document outlining the principles for environment design, including lighting style, color usage, architectural themes, and level of clutter.
    *   **Definition of Done:** An "Environment Design" section is written and added to the Art Style Guide with clear written principles and visual examples.

#### 2. Design Visual Language for Tiers

**Overall Goal:** Make the 12-tier system immediately understandable and visually impressive to players.

*   **2.1: Define Tier-Based Color Palette**
    *   **Information Needed:** A specific primary and secondary color assigned to the VFX and UI elements for each of the 12 tiers to signify power level.
    *   **Definition of Done:** A color palette chart for all 12 tiers is created and added to the Art Style Guide.

*   **2.2: Design Tier-Based VFX Intensity and Complexity**
    *   **Information Needed:** A guide that specifies how the scale, particle count, and complexity of visual effects will increase with each tier.
    *   **Definition of Done:** A "VFX Tier Scaling" section is added to the Art Style Guide, with visual mockups or concept art demonstrating the progression from a Tier 11 to a Tier 1 attack.

#### 3. Document Animation System Requirements

**Overall Goal:** Provide the engineering team with a clear specification for the animation system.

*   **3.1: Create Animation State Machine Diagram**
    *   **Information Needed:** A visual diagram showing all possible character states (e.g., Idle, Walk, Jump, Hitstun, Block) and the transitions between them.
    *   **Definition of Done:** A state machine diagram is created using a tool like Miro or Lucidchart and embedded in a new `ANIMATION_SYSTEM_TDD.md` document.

*   **3.2: Define Animation Blending Rules**
    *   **Information Needed:** Rules for how animations should blend into each other to create smooth transitions (e.g., time required to blend from a run to an idle state).
    *   **Definition of Done:** The blending rules and timings are documented in the `ANIMATION_SYSTEM_TDD.md`.

---

#### 4. Establish VFX Categories

**Overall Goal:** Create a clear and organized system for producing and implementing visual effects.

*   **4.1: Define VFX Naming Convention**
    *   **Information Needed:** A consistent naming convention for VFX assets (e.g., `VFX_{CharacterName}_{MoveName}_{Tier}`).
    *   **Definition of Done:** The naming convention is documented in the Art Style Guide.

*   **4.2: Create VFX Category Matrix**
    *   **Information Needed:** A matrix that categorizes all move types (Light, Medium, Heavy, Special, Ultimate) against different impact types (Hit, Block, Whiff, Parry) to define what kind of VFX is needed for each scenario.
    *   **Definition of Done:** A table is created in the Art Style Guide that lists all required VFX permutations.

---

#### 5. Create UI/UX Mockups

**Overall Goal:** Design a clear, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface.

*   **5.1: Create Wireframes for Core Screens**
    *   **Information Needed:** Low-fidelity wireframes for the Main Menu, Character Select screen, Stage Select screen, and the in-game HUD.
    *   **Definition of Done:** The wireframes are created in a tool like Figma or Balsamiq and approved for their layout and flow.

*   **5.2: Create High-Fidelity Mockups**
    *   **Information Needed:** Based on the approved wireframes and the Art Style Guide, create full-color, high-fidelity mockups of the core screens.
    *   **Definition of Done:** The high-fidelity mockups are completed and approved, ready for implementation.

---

#### 6. Develop a Localization Plan

**Overall Goal:** Ensure the game can be efficiently translated and released in multiple languages.

*   **6.1: Identify Target Languages**
    *   **Information Needed:** A list of target languages for localization based on market research.
    *   **Definition of Done:** A final list of target languages is approved and documented in a new `LOCALIZATION_PLAN.md` file.

*   **6.2: Design Localization-Friendly Text System**
    *   **Information Needed:** A technical plan for a text system where all user-facing strings are stored in external files (e.g., JSON or CSV) and referenced by keys, rather than being hard-coded.
    *   **Definition of Done:** The design for the text system is documented in the `LOCALIZATION_PLAN.md`.

---

#### 7. Define Asset Specifications

**Overall Goal:** Ensure all art assets are created to a consistent technical standard for optimal performance.

*   **7.1: Define Character Asset Specifications**
    *   **Information Needed:** Maximum polygon count, texture map sizes (e.g., 2048x2048), and required texture types (e.g., Albedo, Normal, Roughness) for all characters.
    *   **Definition of Done:** A "Character Specifications" section is added to the Art Style Guide with these technical requirements.

*   **7.2: Define Environment Asset Specifications**
    *   **Information Needed:** Maximum polygon count and texture sizes for environmental props and level geometry.
    *   **Definition of Done:** An "Environment Specifications" section is added to the Art Style Guide with these technical requirements.
