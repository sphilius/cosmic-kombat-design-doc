# Cosmic Kombat: Battle of the Tiers

A revolutionary fighting game that faithfully implements the VSBattles Wiki power scaling tiers while maintaining competitive balance through clever game design.

- **Marvel Rivals**: Team-ups, environmental interaction

## Unique Features

- **Team-Up Synergies**: Form partnerships for unique cooperative moves
- **Tier-Based Environmental Destruction**: Higher-tier characters can dramatically alter the battlefield
