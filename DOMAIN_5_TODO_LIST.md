*   **1.2: Design Matchmaking Flow and Logic**
    *   **Information Needed:** A flowchart illustrating the steps the matchmaking system takes from a player queuing to entering a match, including how it expands search criteria over time.
    *   **Definition of Done:** A detailed flowchart and accompanying logic description are created and embedded in the `MATCHMAKING_DESIGN.md` file.

#### 2. Implement Skill-Based Ranking System

**Overall Goal:** Provide a competitive ladder for players to climb, track their progress, and engage with the game long-term.

*   **2.1: Select Ranking Algorithm**
    *   **Information Needed:** A decision on the specific algorithm to use (e.g., ELO, TrueSkill, or a custom MMR system), including its mathematical basis and how it handles wins/losses, draws, and disconnects.
    *   **Definition of Done:** The chosen algorithm and its core principles are documented in a new `RANKING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` file.

*   **2.2: Define Seasonal Resets and Rewards**
    *   **Information Needed:** A plan for how often seasons will reset (e.g., quarterly), how player ranks will be affected by a reset (e.g., soft reset), and what cosmetic or in-game currency rewards will be given for achieving certain ranks.
    *   **Definition of Done:** The seasonal reset and reward structure is documented in the `RANKING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` file.

---

#### 3. Create Tournament Mode Feature List

**Overall Goal:** Enable organized competitive play directly within the game client.

*   **3.1: Define Core Tournament Structure**
    *   **Information Needed:** A plan for the types of tournaments supported (e.g., single-elimination, double-elimination, round-robin), bracket sizes, and entry requirements.
    *   **Definition of Done:** The core tournament structures are documented in a new `TOURNAMENT_MODE_DESIGN.md` file.

*   **3.2: List Spectator and Replay Features for Tournaments**
    *   **Information Needed:** Specific features required for tournament spectators (e.g., multiple camera angles, player statistics overlay) and how replays of tournament matches will be handled.
    *   **Definition of Done:** A list of spectator and replay features specific to tournament mode is added to the `TOURNAMENT_MODE_DESIGN.md` file.

---

#### 4. Document Battle Pass Pipeline

**Overall Goal:** Establish a clear process for creating, implementing, and delivering seasonal Battle Pass content.

*   **4.1: Define Battle Pass Content Categories**
    *   **Information Needed:** A list of all types of content that can be included in a Battle Pass (e.g., character skins, emotes, profile icons, in-game currency, XP boosts).
    *   **Definition of Done:** A list of Battle Pass content categories is documented in a new `BATTLE_PASS_PIPELINE.md` file.

*   **4.2: Outline Content Creation and Integration Workflow**
    *   **Information Needed:** A step-by-step workflow from concept art to final in-game implementation for Battle Pass items, including approval stages.
    *   **Definition of Done:** A detailed workflow diagram and description are added to the `BATTLE_PASS_PIPELINE.md` file.

---

#### 5. Plan Community Features

**Overall Goal:** Foster a vibrant and engaged player community within and outside the game.

*   **5.1: Design In-Game Leaderboards**
    *   **Information Needed:** A plan for various leaderboards (e.g., global rank, regional rank, character-specific rank, friends-only), including what statistics they track.
    *   **Definition of Done:** The design for all in-game leaderboards is documented in a new `COMMUNITY_FEATURES.md` file.

*   **5.2: Plan Social Integration**
    *   **Information Needed:** A strategy for integrating with external social platforms (e.g., Discord, Twitch) and in-game social features (e.g., friends list, private messaging, guilds/clans).
    *   **Definition of Done:** The social integration strategy and in-game social features are documented in the `COMMUNITY_FEATURES.md` file.

---

#### 6. Design Content Update Pipeline

**Overall Goal:** Ensure a smooth and reliable process for delivering patches, new characters, and stages post-launch.

*   **6.1: Define Patching Strategy**
    *   **Information Needed:** A plan for how patches will be delivered (e.g., full client download, delta patching), frequency of patches, and rollback procedures.
    *   **Definition of Done:** The patching strategy is documented in a new `CONTENT_UPDATE_PIPELINE.md` file.

*   **6.2: Outline New Content Release Workflow**
    *   **Information Needed:** A step-by-step workflow for releasing new characters, stages, and game modes, from development to live deployment.
    *   **Definition of Done:** A detailed workflow diagram and description are added to the `CONTENT_UPDATE_PIPELINE.md` file.

#### 7. Design Live Telemetry Backend

**Overall Goal:** Collect and analyze player data to inform game design, balance, and business decisions.

*   **7.1: Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
    *   **Information Needed:** A list of critical metrics to track (e.g., daily active users, match completion rate, character win rates, monetization conversion).
    *   **Definition of Done:** A list of KPIs is documented in a new `TELEMETRY_BACKEND_DESIGN.md` file.

*   **7.2: Design Data Collection and Storage Strategy**
    *   **Information Needed:** A plan for how player data will be collected (e.g., event-based, periodic snapshots), stored (e.g., database type, schema), and accessed for analysis.
    *   **Definition of Done:** The data collection and storage strategy, including a high-level schema, is documented in the `TELEMETRY_BACKEND_DESIGN.md` file.
