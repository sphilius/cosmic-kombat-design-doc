# Hybrid Combat System

## Dual Health System

Cosmic Kombat implements a unique dual health system that combines elements from Super Smash Bros and Mortal Kombat:

1. **Percentage Damage** (Smash Bros style)
   - Starts at 0% and increases as character takes damage
   - Higher percentage increases knockback distance
   - Contributes to ring-out victory condition

2. **Health Bar** (Mortal Kombat style)
   - Depletes as character takes damage
   - When fully depleted, character is defeated
   - Used for health-depletion victory condition
