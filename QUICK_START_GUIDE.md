## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Stick to 6 characters for demo
   - Don't add features until core is solid
   - Hard feature lock at each milestone

2. **Art Perfectionism**
   - Get playable mechanics first (placeholder art is fine)
   - Commission art once mechanics are proven
   - Don't remake art multiple times

3. **Trying to Do Everything**
   - Outsource art if budget allows
   - Focus on programming and design
   - Don't try to master 3D modeling, animation, music, etc.

4. **Burnout**
   - Take regular breaks (1 week off every 3 months)
   - Set realistic weekly hour goals
   - Join communities for support

5. **Comparing to AAA**
   - You're one person, not a 50-person team
   - Focus on your unique strengths (training mode!)
   - Embrace indie aesthetic
