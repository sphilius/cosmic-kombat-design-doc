# Cosmic Kombat: Architecture Analysis & Development Roadmap

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** Strategic Planning

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) analysis of the Cosmic Kombat architecture, identifies 5 high-impact features for immediate development, defines 5 critical next actions, and outlines a detailed roadmap from the current design documentation state through vertical slice demo to full game completion.

**Current State:** 40-50% design documentation complete with strong mechanical foundations but lacking character-specific content, visual identity, and multiplayer infrastructure.

**Target State:** Production-ready vertical slice demo within 9 months, full game completion within 30 months.

## Part 6: Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

#### Risk 1: Tier System Not Fun in Practice
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Critical
**Mitigation:**
- Prototype tier differences in vertical slice
- Extensive playtesting with fighting game community
- Adjustable difficulty balancing to compensate
- Allow tier restrictions in competitive modes if needed

---

#### Risk 2: Netcode Performance Below Expectations
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Critical
**Mitigation:**
- GGPO is proven technology
- Hire network specialist early
- Alpha test with diverse connection qualities
- Budget extra time for optimization (2-3 months buffer)

---

#### Risk 3: Scope Creep Delays Launch
**Probability:** High
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Hard feature locks at each milestone
- Monthly scope reviews with producer

---

#### Risk 4: Character Production Too Slow
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**

- Outsource non-hero characters if needed
- Reduce roster size (15 ‚Üí 12) if timeline at risk
- Procedural VFX reduces per-character asset burden

---

#### Risk 5: Insufficient Marketing / No Community
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Hire community manager during beta
