## üî• Critical Decisions Needed

These decisions are **blocking development** and must be made before meaningful implementation work can begin:

### Decision 1: Visual Art Direction (Blocking all art production)
**Status:** üî¥ UNRESOLVED - Highest Priority

**What needs to be decided:**
- [ ] Art style: Realistic vs. Stylized vs. Anime vs. Hybrid?
- [ ] Visual presentation: 3D with camera angles or 2.5D fixed plane?
- [ ] Color philosophy: How do tiers differentiate visually?
- [ ] Character design principles: Humanoid focus or diverse forms?
- [ ] VFX intensity scaling: How do higher tiers look more powerful?

**Why it's blocking:**
- Cannot begin character concept art
- Cannot hire artists without clear direction
- Cannot estimate art production timeline
- Cannot create UI mockups

**Who should decide:** Art Director (need to hire or assign)

**Timeline:** Week 1-2 (immediate)

**Recommendation from analysis:**
Create comprehensive style guide (50+ pages) with mood boards, reference images, and tier visual differentiation guide.

---

### Decision 2: Character Roster & Archetypes (Blocking gameplay implementation)
**Status:** üî¥ UNRESOLVED - Highest Priority

**What needs to be decided:**
- [ ] How many launch characters? (Analysis suggests 15-20)
- [ ] Character distribution across tiers (recommended: 2-3 per tier)
- [ ] Archetype diversity: Rushdown, Zoner, Grappler, All-rounder, etc.?
- [ ] Guest characters or original IP only?
- [ ] Character selection for vertical slice (need 2 specific characters)

**Why it's blocking:**
- Cannot create character specifications
- Cannot prototype combat without concrete movesets
- Cannot balance without knowing full roster
- Cannot create marketing materials

**Who should decide:** Game Director + Design Lead

**Timeline:** Week 1-2 (immediate)

**Recommendation from analysis:**
1. Define character specification template (standardized format)
2. Create 2 complete character specs for vertical slice:
   - One Tier 11 character (easier to implement)
   - One Tier 8 character (different weight class)
3. Plan remaining roster over next 3 months

---

### Decision 3: Core Combat Mechanics Details (Blocking prototype)
**Status:** üü° PARTIAL - High Priority

**What's defined:**
- ‚úÖ Dual health system concept
- ‚úÖ Tier-based scaling concept
- ‚úÖ Frame data philosophy

**What needs to be decided:**
- [ ] Universal mechanics available to ALL characters (walk, dash, jump, air dash?)
- [ ] Attack button layout: Light/Medium/Heavy or Punch/Kick or custom?
- [ ] Special moves: Motion inputs (quarter-circle) or simple button combos?
- [ ] Blocking: Auto-block, hold-back, or dedicated button?
- [ ] Throw/grab mechanics: Command grabs vs. universal throw?
- [ ] Air combat: Full air combos or limited juggling?
- [ ] Meter system: Does it exist? How is it gained/spent?
- [ ] Guard break mechanics: Can blocks be broken?
- [ ] Counter/parry system: Exists or not?

**Why it's blocking:**
- Cannot implement character controller without universal mechanics
- Cannot design movesets without knowing button layout
- Cannot balance without complete rules

**Who should decide:** Game Designer + Input from Fighting Game Community advisors

**Timeline:** Week 2-3

**Recommendation from analysis:**
Document all universal mechanics with exact frame data and input specifications. Create a "mechanics bible" document.

---

### Decision 4: Development Staffing & Budget (Blocking timeline)
**Status:** üü° PARTIAL - High Priority

**What needs to be decided:**
- [ ] Is this a funded studio project or indie/bootstrapped?
- [ ] Budget available: $12.7M (full plan) or constrained budget?
- [ ] Can we hire 8 people for vertical slice? (Minimum team size)
- [ ] Internal development vs. outsourcing strategy?
- [ ] Timeline: Can we commit to 9-month vertical slice?

**Why it's blocking:**
- Cannot create realistic production schedule
- Cannot scope features appropriately
- Cannot begin hiring/recruiting
- May need to adjust roadmap for budget constraints

**Who should decide:** Project Lead / Studio Head / Investors

**Timeline:** Week 1 (immediate)

**Recommendation from analysis:**
If budget is constrained, consider:
- Smaller initial roster (2-4 characters for demo)
- Outsource non-core art assets
- Focus on core mechanics and training mode (unique differentiators)
- Seek publisher or investor funding after vertical slice

---

### Decision 5: Story Mode Scope & Approach (Affects content planning)
**Status:** üî¥ UNRESOLVED - Medium Priority

**What needs to be decided:**
- [ ] Story mode scale: Full narrative campaign or minimal arcade mode endings?
- [ ] Voice acting: Fully voiced or text-only?
- [ ] Cutscene style: In-engine or pre-rendered or static art with dialogue?
- [ ] Narrative approach: Connected story or individual character episodes?
- [ ] Tier-based branching: Implement as designed or simplify?

**Why it matters:**
- Huge impact on budget (voice acting + cutscenes = $500K-$1M)
- Affects writing and narrative team needs
- Single-player content crucial for sales
- Can be scoped down if budget limited

**Who should decide:** Creative Director + Producer

**Timeline:** Month 2-3 (not immediate, but plan early)

**Recommendation from analysis:**
- Vertical slice: Skip story mode entirely (not needed for demo)
- Alpha: Minimal arcade mode with text endings
- Beta: Full story mode if budget allows
- Consider story mode as post-launch DLC if budget tight

---

### Decision 6: Platform Strategy (Affects technical architecture)
**Status:** üü° PARTIAL - Medium Priority

**What's defined:**
- ‚úÖ PC (Windows) confirmed for vertical slice
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform play desired

**What needs to be decided:**
- [ ] Launch platforms: PC + Console (PS5/Xbox) or PC-only first?
- [ ] Console certification timeline and costs accounted for?
- [ ] Mobile version: Ever planned or never?
- [ ] Steam vs. Epic vs. Multi-store on PC?
- [ ] Cross-play between PC and consoles from day 1?

**Why it matters:**
- Console certification adds 3-6 months to timeline
- Different platforms have different input considerations
- Budget impact ($200K+ for console certification)
- Marketing and player pool size

**Who should decide:** Business Lead + Technical Lead

**Timeline:** Month 1-2

**Recommendation from analysis:**
- Vertical slice: PC-only (Windows, Steam)
- Launch: PC + PS5 + Xbox Series X/S with cross-play
- Defer: Mobile version (different design challenges)

---

### Decision 7: Matchmaking & Online Features (Affects backend architecture)
**Status:** üü° PARTIAL - Lower Priority (for now)

**What's defined:**
- ‚úÖ GGPO rollback netcode planned
- ‚úÖ Ranked/unranked modes desired

**What needs to be decided:**
- [ ] Skill-based matchmaking algorithm: ELO, Glicko-2, or custom?
- [ ] Ranking system: Leagues (Bronze/Silver/Gold) or pure MMR?
- [ ] Region locking or global matchmaking?
- [ ] Party/group matchmaking for friends?
- [ ] Connection quality requirements (minimum acceptable ping)?

**Why it matters:**
- Matchmaking design affects player retention
- Backend architecture must support chosen system
- Competitive community needs good ranking system

**Who should decide:** Technical Lead + Community Manager + Live Ops Designer

**Timeline:** Month 6-8 (during online implementation)

**Recommendation from analysis:**
